# Spam Detector

## Overview
This project implements a spam detector using machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Library, containing email features like word frequencies and character frequencies. The primary goal is to compare the performance of two models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-detector.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook `spam_detector.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions and code cells sequentially to:
   - Import and explore the dataset.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Scale the features using StandardScaler.
   - Create and fit a Logistic Regression model.
   - Create and fit a Random Forest Classifier model.
   - Evaluate the models and compare their accuracy scores.
